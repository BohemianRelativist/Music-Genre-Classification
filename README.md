# Music Genre Classification 
The goal of this project was to identify 10 different genres of music using machine learning. The dataset used was GT-ZAN, and the genres were:
* Blues
* Classical
* Country
* Disco
* Hiphop
* Jazz
* Metal
* Pop
* Reggae
* Rock

The spectrogram of all the audio files were made and then were fed to the NN as input. 

PyTorch was used to make the Neural Net, it had 3 convolutional layers, and four linear layers each with ReLu activation function. 

Maximum test case accuracy obtained was 70.7%
